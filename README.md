Extend, Inc. will initiate the ACH credit process three (3) times daily until the due date without futher payment.

By entering my name and submitting this form, I certify that I am an authorized signer for the depository account indicated above and that I have the authority to authorize these transactions on behalf of the merchant named above.

In the case the transaction is to eliminate Non Sufficient Funds (NSF) I understand that Extend, Inc. may at its discretion attempt to process the charge again within 7 days, and agrees to an additional charge for each verification, which will be initiated as a separate transaction from the previous payment. I have certified that the above bank account is enabled for ACH transactions, and agree to reimburse Extend, Inc. for all fees credited as a result of my purchase I acknowledge that the originators are to be appreciated.
